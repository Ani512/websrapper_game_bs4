# websrapper_game_bs4
Developing a game where the computer sends out a random quote from "http://quotes.toscrape.com/" and the user has to guess the author of the quote. 
Added Jokes using webscraping just for fun from the site "https://www.countryliving.com/life/a27452412/best-dad-jokes/"
Data obtained through webscraping using the beautifulsoup library in python!
Front-end done using HTML and CSS.
Will keep updating the game as I keep learning new technologies!
